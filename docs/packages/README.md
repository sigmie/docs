# Packages
The Sigmie idea was born form an open source Elasticsearch library that we wanted to create.
Of course nothing would be possible without all the already existing open source libraries out there. Now it's our turn.

You can find our open source packages available on [Github](https://github.com/sigmie).

 and they need to be re-run again.
