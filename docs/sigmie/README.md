# Sigmie

Sigmie started as an free open source library which would the common problems
which people developers encounter when using Elasticsearch as a search engine
empowering their site.

After some months and some rewrites of the Sigmie library we realized that,
there were so much more stuff that we could help with. And that's how the
[Sigmie Application](/app/) idea was born. 

Because how could you use our library without an Elasticsearch server ?!

So now Sigmie has become the core component of the [Sigmie Application](https://app.sigmie.com) and
they are developed in parallel. Nevertheless the Sigmie library remains free and open source 
under the MIT license.
